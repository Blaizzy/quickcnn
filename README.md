QuickCNN is high-level library written in Python, and backed by the [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), and [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) libraries. It was developed to exercise faster experimentation with Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). Majorly, it is intended to use the [Google-Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) to quickly train the ConvNet architectures.

#### Why Google-Colaboratory:question:

> :free: GPU: 1xTesla K80, compute 3.7, having 2496 CUDA cores, 12GB GDDR5 VRAM

> :free: CPU: 1xsingle core hyper threaded Xeon Processors @2.3Ghz i.e(1 core, 2 threads)

> :free: RAM: ~12.6 GB Available

> :free: Disk: ~33 GB Available
