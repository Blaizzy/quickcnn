QuickCNN is high-level library written in Python, and backed by the [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), and [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) libraries. It was developed to exercise faster experimentation with Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). Majorly, it is intended to use the [Google-Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) to quickly train the ConvNet architectures.

#### Go for QuickCNN if you are thinking of:

- ConvNet training for Image classification on any size of dataset with GPU.

- Transfer Learning, Finetuning, and Scratch Training of Deep ConvNet models.

- Babysitting the pretrained ConvNet architectures.

- Training SVM on ConvNet features from particular layer.

- Colab for training Deep CNN models.

#### Why Google-Colaboratory:question:

It gives you massive computing power with following specification: :free:

- GPU: 1xTesla K80, compute 3.7, having 2496 CUDA cores, 12GB GDDR5 VRAM

- CPU: 1xsingle core hyper threaded Xeon Processors @2.3Ghz i.e(1 core, 2 threads)

- RAM: ~12.6 GB Available

- Disk: ~33 GB Available
